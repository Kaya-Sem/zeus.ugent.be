Join us on November 10th as Bas Peters from GitHub will talk about using open source best practices for developing software. If you're new to open source, or its workflows, it's a proven way of bringing the collaborative nature of software development in an open environment by doing so online inside of GitHub. The principles of open source have proven themselves time and time again for large software projects at Facebook, Dropbox, and many others. After this lecture students will understand the value of collaborative coding and why it is an essential skill for any software developer to be successful.

The talk will be given in English with the possibility to ask questions in Dutch.

Location: <strong>Auditorium A2, Sterre S9</strong>
Time: <strong>November 10th, 13:00</strong>
