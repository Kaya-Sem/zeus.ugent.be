We like games. We like programming. So we decided to build our very own programming game. Now, we would like to share. Welcome to <strong>Badass Battle Bots</strong>.
The objective of the game is to write a computer program that will take on other competitors' programs in a grand battle for honour, glory and world domination. Sounds exciting? You bet it is!
We are working hard to create a game that is exciting yet very simple, so that anyone with minimal coding skills can participate.
So, what can you expect? There will be a series of codenights where we kindly invite you to exchange strategies with your peers, get some assistance when you are stuck, trash-talk your opponents, or compete in a preliminary tournament to show your strength. We will top this off with a grand tournament, where you will see the action unfold before your eyes. There will be prizes.

The rules for this game will be disclosed on <strong>Tuesday March 1st</strong>. On this day, we will organise an introductory session starting at <strong>18h in computer room Hopper (campus De Sterre, building S5)</strong>. Be sure to stop by, we'd love to help you get started.

On this same date we will announce the date of the final tournament. You can count on a few weeks to code your bot.

For those unable to attend, all information will be made available on <a href="https://zeus.ugent.be/battlebots" target="_blank">zeus.ugent.be/battlebots</a>.
