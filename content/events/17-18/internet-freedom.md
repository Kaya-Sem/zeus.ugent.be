# Our Freedom At Stake

In the last year, Net Neutrality has been a hot topic in the news.
America is creating a law that would allow ISP's to make your connection to any service (e.g. Netflix) slower, unless you pay an extra fee.

Regulations like this are not only happening across the Atlantic sea, but also in our own continent. The European Union is finally reforming our copyright laws and some laws that won't do any good for your freedom. Like sharing articles on Facebook and Twitter? With the reform, this could become a crime... Come to the talks and we will explain you why and we will tell you how we can stop it.

## The speakers

Ruben Verborgh is a professor at Ghent University. As an expert in the Web, decentralization, he will bring you up-to-date with the state of Net Neutrality. What is happening and why should it be prevented?

### [Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/en/) (European Parliament)

Julia is a member of the European Parliament. She will tell us about how the [EU copyright reform](https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/) will be beneficial to how we can use the Web as a way to express ourselves.
